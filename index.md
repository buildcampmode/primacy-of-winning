# Foundational Culture at Palantir: Shaping Tomorrow’s Software

**`Missionaries, Gamma Rays, and the Chaos of Innovation: Lessons from Palantir`**

<aside>
🚀

For nearly two decades, my career as a Go-To-Market practitioner at large Hi-tech firms followed a familiar script: prioritize predictable revenue streams, hit those quarterly targets, and stick to the established playbook.  Success was measured in metrics, not in any deeper sense of purpose or impact and while it brought financial rewards, it also led to a growing sense of disconnect.

In contrast to these norms, **Shyam Sankar**, CTO of [**Palantir Technologies**](https://www.palantir.com/), offers a refreshing and battle-tested perspective in his [**Pirate Wires**](https://www.piratewires.com/) article. His emphasis on the “[**Primacy of Winning**](https://www.piratewires.com/p/primacy-of-winning-shyam-sankar-palantir)” challenges us to redefine success, prioritize purpose, and ultimately, achieve a more meaningful impact.
