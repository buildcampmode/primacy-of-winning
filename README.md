# Primacy of Winning – Foundational Culture at Palantir

This repository hosts a Markdown rendition of **Shyam Sankar’s** essay _“Foundational Culture at Palantir: Shaping Tomorrow’s Software”_.
The essay outlines Palantir’s **Primacy of Winning** philosophy — a culture built around audacious missions, focusing on product-led problem
solving and building software that feels like magic.  It contrasts _missionary_ and _mercenary_ mindsets, examines the friction between
innovation and enterprise inertia, and shares lessons on cultivating a company culture where purpose and impact trump quarterly targets.
